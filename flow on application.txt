Administrator — full in-app flow & capabilities

Great — here’s a clear, practical map of what an Administrator can do in your app, and how those actions flow through the system. I’ll describe screens, permissions, configuration, the lifecycle of an incoming message from admin perspective, and a prioritized checklist of admin tasks you should support.


---

1 — Admin role: summary of powers

As an Administrator you can:

Manage integrations (connect/disconnect Outlook, IMAP, WhatsApp, Gmail, SMS).

Manage users & roles (create agents, managers, set RBAC).

Configure routing & automation rules (intent → queue → SLA → priority).

Manage organization settings / tenant config (domains, sender addresses, email templates).

Configure Grok (AI) settings (enable/disable, thresholds, KB sources).

View analytics & reports (team performance, intent distribution, costs).

Manage security & compliance (PII rules, retention, audit logs, SSO).

Configure billing & subscription options.

Monitor system health (queue backlogs, API errors, Grok usage & cost).

Run tests & onboarding (integration tests, seed data).

Access logs & exports (message export, audit export, backups).



---

2 — Admin UI pages (recommended)

Each page should be accessible in the left nav under an Admin menu.

1. Dashboard (Admin view) — Overview: Active integrations, unread messages, Grok health, queue backlogs, SLA violations, monthly cost.


2. Integrations — Connect/Disconnect Outlook, IMAP, WhatsApp; manage OAuth; test connectivity; sync logs.


3. Users & Roles — Add user, set role (Admin / Manager / Agent / Read-only), manage teams, disable/reactivate accounts.


4. Routing & Automations — Visual rule builder (if intent == X and customer_tier == Y → assign to queue Z; auto-reply templates, escalation rules).


5. Grok / AI Console — Enable/disable, confidence thresholds, KB connectors (docs, vector DB), prompt templates, tokens usage, call logs, feedback loop metrics.


6. Templates & Macros — Email & WhatsApp templates, canned replies, signature management.


7. Organization Settings — Company details, domain verification (for Outlook), mail sending settings, SSO / OAuth config.


8. Security & Compliance — PII redaction rules, retention policy, 2FA enforcement, audit log viewer.


9. Analytics & Reports — Agent metrics, conversation metrics, intent trends, cost-per-call. Export CSV/PDF.


10. System Health & Logs — Worker queue monitoring, Grok errors, API error logs, scheduled job status.


11. Billing & Subscription — Plan, usage, invoices, payment method.


12. Test Tools / Sandbox — Send test messages, run integration test flows, preview templates.


13. Backups & Restore — Manage backups and data export.

3 — Admin flows (step-by-step typical tasks)

A. Onboard a new company (tenant)

1. Admin creates organization or buys subscription.


2. Admin verifies domain (DNS TXT) for email sending & Outlook integration.


3. Admin configures primary email addresses and SMTP/IMAP settings or connects Microsoft 365.


4. Admin creates teams and invites users (Agents / Managers) with roles.


5. Admin sets up basic routing rules and templates.


6. Run an integration test from Test Tools.



B. Connect Outlook / Email domain

1. Go to Integrations → Outlook.


2. Click Connect → OAuth flow → Admin consents (tenant-wide) if required.


3. Verify account and enable sync (choose folders to sync, date range).


4. Run Sync Now or schedule periodic sync.


5. Monitor logs for errors; adjust permissions in Azure if necessary.



C. Connect a non-Microsoft email (IMAP)

1. Go to Integrations → Add Email.


2. Enter IMAP/SMTP host, ports, credentials (with option for OAuth/APP Password).


3. Test connection.


4. Save and enable automatic sync.


5. Admin configures attachment limits and mailbox polling intervals.



D. Configure Grok (AI) behavior

1. Open Grok Console.


2. Enable Grok for channels (email/WhatsApp/chat).


3. Choose confidence thresholds for auto-send vs agent-only suggestions.


4. Configure KB connectors (vector DB/Docs); set snippet length.


5. Define PII redaction settings and allowed fields.


6. Save and run a sample message to validate output schema.



E. Create / Edit Routing Rules

1. Go to Routing & Automations.


2. Use visual builder: add condition(s): if intent == "refund_request" and tier == "gold" → route to: billing_team, priority = high, SLA = 4 hours.


3. Add escalation: if not handled in 2 hours → notify manager.


4. Save rule and run test message.



F. Monitor & Respond to Alerts

1. Alerts show on Dashboard (e.g., Grok error spikes, queue backlog).


2. Admin opens System Health, inspects worker logs.


3. If integration failure: open Integrations, click Reconnect or view OAuth expiry.


4. If Grok costs high: adjust sampling rate or disable for low-value intents.




---

4 — Incoming message lifecycle (Admin view)

This explains the message flow visible to an admin:

1. Message received by connector (Outlook/IMAP/WhatsApp).


2. Message stored raw in DB and counts toward tenant usage.


3. Admin rules check: basic filters (blocklist, dedupe).


4. Enqueue Grok job if AI enabled (or skip if disabled).


5. Grok processes and writes summary/intent/entities back to message record.


6. Routing Engine evaluates (intent + rules) → assign to queue/agent → SLA timer starts.


7. Agent receives message in UI (sees summary & suggestions).


8. Agent action: send reply / create ticket / escalate.


9. Action logged (admin sees in audit logs).


10. Analytics update: metrics updated and visible in reports.



Admin can step in at any point to:

pause routing rules,

reroute conversation to another team,

mark conversation escalated,

re-run Grok with updated KB, or

redact sensitive text in record (if needed).

Check Dashboard for alerts & backlogs.

Review low-confidence Grok queues and reassign.

Approve pending users/invites.


Weekly

Review intent distribution & agent performance.

Tune routing rules & confidence thresholds.

Spot-check audit logs and PII redaction.


Monthly

Review Grok usage & costs; adjust sampling.

Review backup status & run a restore test.

Review retention/compliance settings & change if needed.



---

7 — Admin troubleshooting checklist (when sync fails)

1. Check Integrations page — did token expire? Reconnect.


2. Check System Health — queue backlog, worker errors.


3. Check Grok Console — API quota or rate limits.


4. Check DNS for domain verification (for Outlook sending).


5. Check logs for authentication rejects (OAuth scope missing).


6. Run Test Tools to reproduce.


7. If IMAP: verify ports, SSL, app password.


8. If Outlook: confirm domain added in Azure AD tenant.




---

8 — Admin onboarding checklist to enable Grok successfully

[ ] Verify domain (if using Microsoft tenant).

[ ] Connect at least one channel (Outlook or IMAP).

[ ] Create teams and users.

[ ] Turn on Grok for selected queues (start with billing/support).

[ ] Seed KB with top 20 documents (FAQ, policy).

[ ] Set thresholds: auto-send >= 0.85; agent-only 0.6–0.85.

[ ] Run 50 test messages and review outputs.



---

9 — Recommended admin controls to build now (prioritized)

1. Integration connect/test UI with token expiry warnings.


2. Grok enable/disable + confidence slider + KB selection.


3. Visual routing rule builder (drag/drop conditions).


4. Audit log viewer with filters (user, action, time).


5. System health page (queue lengths, Grok latency, error rate).


6. Template manager for fast replies.


7. Test tools / sandbox.




---

10 — Example admin scenarios (quick wins)

“We get a lot of refund requests — auto-route them to billing and give agents a 1-line summary.” → Admin creates rule: intent==refund → route billing; enable Grok for summary; add invoice lookup macro.

“Grok is expensive — only use it for gold-tier customers.” → Admin sets rule: if customer.tier == gold → enable Grok else skip.

“Our Outlook integration stopped syncing” → Admin dashboard shows OAuth expired → Admin re-authenticates and triggers a manual sync.



---

If you’d like, I can:

generate the Admin UI wireframes (screens + actions) for each page above, or

produce an Admin onboarding checklist PDF you can use with your team, or

create sample RBAC JSON and database schema for user roles and permissions.


Which one shall I create next?



Here is the complete flow and capabilities for an Employee (Agent) inside your application — clear, structured, and practical.
This is the exact behaviour your app should support for a normal employee user (non-admin).

3 — Employee conversation flow (step-by-step)

This is what happens when an employee handles a message:


---

Step 1 — Conversation arrives in the queue

Message enters a team queue via routing rules (admin-configured).

Employee sees:

🔔 New conversation alert

Summary generated by Grok

Intent category (ex: Refund Request)

Priority (High/Normal/Low)

SLA timer (ex: 45 minutes left)


Employee clicks to open.


---

Step 2 — Employee views AI assistance

Inside the conversation:

AI Summary: 1–2 lines

AI Intent & Confidence

Entities: invoice numbers, dates, amounts

Reply Suggestions:

Short

Medium

Formal


Routing recommendation (if employee wants to re-route)



---

Step 3 — Employee chooses how to respond

Employee has three options:

Option A: Send AI suggestion as-is

If confidence is high (>0.85), system allows one-click send.

Option B: Edit AI suggestion

Opens message composer pre-filled with AI text.

Option C: Write manual reply

Employee can ignore AI and write from scratch.

When employee sends:

Message is logged

Thread updated

SLA updated

Analytics updated



---

Step 4 — Employee adds notes or tags

Employees can:

Add internal notes (“Customer seems upset, asked for faster resolution”)

Add tags (refund, complaint, follow-up)

Attach files

Request manager approval


These are not visible to customer.


---

Step 5 — Employee can escalate

If needed, employee can:

Escalate to a manager

Escalate to another queue (ex: billing → finance)

Mark as “Needs Admin Action”


System logs who escalated and why.


---

Step 6 — Close or Resolve conversation

Once resolved, employee clicks:

Close Conversation
or
Mark as Resolved

SLA stops and analytics updated.


---

Step 7 — Employee gives AI feedback

In every conversation, agent sees:

👍 “Helpful”
👎 “Not helpful”

This feedback trains your future prompt improvements.
